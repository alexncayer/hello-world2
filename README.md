#About me based on the past read-me branch of hello-world2
I am a graduate student at Concordia University Wisconsin and pursuing a master's degree in Information Systems. I graduated as an undergraduate in May 2021 cum laude with a major in Information Technology and a minor in Environmental Studies. In my free time, I like to play my cello, video games, watch anime, and read managa or japanese comics.
